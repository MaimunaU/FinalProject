    <h1>Snakes</h1>
    <p class="opening">There are 5 snake species that are endangered or at risk of being endangered in New York State.
        <br>
        They are the Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake, Queen Snake, Timber Rattlesnake, Eastern Hognose Snake, and Worm Snake.
        <br>
        (In order from most at danger to least).
    </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">The Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <img src="/FinalProject/snakeImages/Massasauga1.jpg">
        <p>This is the eastern massasauga rattlesnake. This snake is listed as an endangered species
            in New York. They are found in wetland/swamp areas and wet prairies in central New York as 
            well as in bordering states. The most notable reasons of decline are loss of habitat to 
            development and agriculture, unregulated hunting, and snake collecting. They are also 
            killed because people fear snakes in general and mistakenly think of them to be a threat.

    <h2 class="subheading">The Queen Snake</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <img id="topQueen">
        <p>This is the queen snake. Although it is one of the more rare snakes in New York, it is 
            labeled as an endangered species in NY. They are found in warm, wet habitats, along rivers 
            and creeks around the east side of the US. These snakes are threatened by habitat destruction 
            from the alteration of habitat features and the fragmentation of habitat by roads or other 
            barriers. They are also greatly affected by any chemical pollutants in the water 
            (plastic, rubber, aluminum, oil/liquids, etc).

    <h2 class="subheading">The Timber Rattlesnake</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <img src="/FinalProject/snakeImages/Timber1.jpg">
        <p>This is the timber rattlesnake. This snake is labeled as a threatened species in NY, 
            which means they are likely to become an endangered species in the near future. They 
            are found in forests and rocky areas around the southeast side of the US. These snakes 
            are also threatened by habitat destruction, road mortality, illegal collection and hunting. 
        </p>

    <h2 class="subheading">The Eastern Hognose Snake</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <img id="topHognose">
        <p>This is the eastern hognose snake. They are listed as special concern, which means they are
            at risk of being endangered. They are found in woody areas, like forests, or sandy areas 
            in the northern parts of New York as well as in some bordering states. Their typical 
            threats include, loss of habitat to suburban development, fragmentation by roads, road 
            mortality, and collection for the pet trade. Like the eastern massasauga, they are often
            killed by people who think of them as threats.
        </p>
        <img id="bottomHognose">
    </div>
    <h2 class="subheading">The Worm Snake</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <img src="/FinalProject/snakeImages/Worm1.jpg">
        <p>This is the worm snake. They are also listed as special concern. They are found in woody 
            areas in southeastern New York and in bordering states. Their primary threat is habitat 
            loss due to suburban development. Sandy areas that worm snakes inhabit are also frequently 
            used by off-road vehicles. Flooding of wooded lowlands and forest fires are also harmful to
            worm snake populations.

    <h2 class="subheading">How you help</h2>
    <p class="closing">Although there isn't much you can actively do to help these snakes, that doesn't mean 
        you can't help at all. Always follow any Environmental Conservation Laws, which are
        usually outlined on signs near a protected site. Even if there are no signs, the basic 
        actions you should keep in mind is to not litter, on both land and water, and do not 
        start a forest fire. Another big thing youshould be aware of is, if you ever encounter
        a snake, just walk away. Whether or not you have knowledge on snakes. This will protect 
        both you and the snake.
