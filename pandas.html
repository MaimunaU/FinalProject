                The Giant Panda also known as Ailuropoda melanoleuca, is native to South China and is characterized by its black
                and white coat as well as its black eye circles. They live mainly in termperate forests high in the mountains 
                where they thrive on bamboo and must consume around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day. Females can grow up to 200 pounds
                and males can grow up to 300 pounds. They are excellent tree climbers but many have been pushed from their natural 
                habitats due to deforestation and habitat loss. Their status is Vulnerable so they are no longer endangered but can
                be at risk of becoming endangered again. There are a few pandas in New York city in zoos such as the Bronx Zoo and 
                discussions have been made to bring another panda to the Central Park Zoo.

    <h2>The Red Panda</h2>
    <div class="gridalt">
        <div class="info">
            <p>
                The Red Panda also known as Ailurus fulgens, is a small mammal native to the Eastern Himalayas and Southwestern
                China. It has reddish-brown fur with a black belly and legs, white-lined ears, a white muzzle and ringed tail. 
                Contrary to its name, the Red Panda is more closesly affiliated with raccoons, weasels, and skunks. It is not 
                closely related to the Giant Panda which is a bear although both have elongated wrist bones used for grabbing
                bamboo. They weigh between 7 and 33 pounds and 20 to 25 inches in length with a 11 to 19 inch tail that they
                use for balance and warmth. Their status is endangered as there are less than 10,000 red pandas worldwide due to
                deforestation and hunting. You can see them in the Bronx and Central Park Zoo.
