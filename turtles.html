    <h1>Turtles</h1>
    <p class="opening">There are 5 turtle species that are endangered in New York State.
        <br>
        They are the Southeastern Mud Turtle, Bog Turtle, Atlantic Hawksbill 
        Sea Turtle, Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtle, and Leatherback Sea Turtle.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">The Southeastern Mud Turtle</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <img id="topMud">
        <p>This is the southeastern mud turtle. They are found all over the southeast side
            of the US in wetland areas, like marshes and ponds.They are most threatened by 
            the loss of habitat due to urban development, road mortality, human-commensal 
            predators (a layer of bacteria on human skin), collection for illegal pet trade, 
            and pollution from oils, road salt, insecticides, pesticides, and etc. 
        </p>

    <h2 class="subheading">The Bog Turtle</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <img src="/turtleImages/Bog1.jpg">
        <p>This is the bog turtle. They are a slightly scattered species, but a large 
            portion of their population is around New York, New Jersey, and Pensylvania. 
            They live in wet areas with shallow, slow-moving water. Their primary threats 
            are loss of habitat and illegal collecting. In New York, development and 
            natural succession are also major threats. 
        </p>

    <h2 class="subheading">The Atlantic Hawksbill Sea Turtle</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <img id="topHawksbill">
        <p>This is the atlantic hawksbill sea turtle. They are found in waters near NY 
            and Massachusetts. However, as a seaturtle they travel all around and 
            between countries. They typically stay in areas close to the shore. 
            Their biggest threat is the destruction of their nests, which are on 
            shore. Tourism has increased the risk of their nests being damaged. 
            Another threat is fishing wires and nets in nearby waters. Since 
            hawksbill sea turtles live so close to shore, they are easily entrapped 
            by fishing supplies left in the water. 
        </p>

    <h2 class="subheading">The Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtle</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <img src="/turtleImages/Ridley1.jpg">
        <p>This is the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle. They are the second most common turtle 
            in NY. They are found in southeast areas of North America (east of the US 
            and Mexico). They can be found near the shore but typically stay farther 
            out. A major threat they face is also fishing materials like netting, and 
            wires. Also as these turtles do not go out to far into open waters, they 
            are also at risk of being hit by water vehicles.  
        </p>
        <img src="/turtleImages/Ridley2.jpg">
    </div>
    <h2 class="subheading">The Leatherback Sea Turtle</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <img id="topLeatherback">
        <p>This is the leatherback sea turtle. They are one of the largest reptile on 
            Earth. They are found in northeast of North America (east of the US and 
            Canada) as well as many other countries. Although they can travel far, 
            they are typically found in deep waters near the shore. Like the other 
            sea turtles, a major threat is fishing materials in the water. As they 
            live near the shore, they are harshly effected by the nets and wires.

    <h2 class="subheading">How you help</h2>
    <p class="closing">Although there isn't much you can actively do to help these turtles, that doesn't mean 
        you can't help at all. Make sure to follow all Environmental Conservation Laws, which 
        are usually shown on signs near any protected sites. Even if there are no signs, keep 
        in mind to not litter, on both land and in water. Also, do not try to touch wild turtles, 
        especially smaller turtles, as our touch can often be harmful to them.

                travel the length of their shell. This gives the turtle the ability to dive 
                down to 1,200m, which is deeper than any other turtle species.</td>
